# Classification
Getting started with Classification


Classification is a fundamental machine learning task that involves assigning labels to input data. This README provides an overview of how to perform classification in Python using popular library such as Scikit-learn. 


**Datasets**
To practice classification, you can use various datasets such as:

Iris Dataset
MNIST Handwritten Digits
Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset


**Key Libraries**
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and tools.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.


Classification is a powerful technique in machine learning used to categorize data. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can effectively implement classification algorithms in Python to solve real-world problems.
